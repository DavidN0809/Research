## Notebooks

- `Attempt Pruning`: This notebook is attempting to prune the model, but it is not currently working.
- `Attempt Resample`: This notebook will be the .py file to run on the Le Potato. It attempts to take any frequency input, resample it down to 16kHz, process it, and then resample it back up to the original frequency. However, it is currently not working.
- `Working Realtime`: This notebook demonstrates realtime audio processing with the pretrained models.
- `Untitled1`: This notebook is for various testing, such as tensor sizes, microphone and headset functionality, etc. It needs to be cleaned up.
